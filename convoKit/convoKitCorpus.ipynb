      "\n",
      "1. Can you explain more in detail, what should I sddelat? Allocate a job? How?\n",
      "2. Will expressions always be unambiguously parenthesized like that, so you don't have to deal with precedence? Or is `X OR Y AND Z` allowed?\n",
      "3. how are you resolving function pointers? I am also writing similar kind of program but still wondering how i will resolve function pointers?\n",
      "4. What is the definition of `buffer`? Is it a local variable?\n",
      "5. Is `A` a global variable?  What is x?\n",
      "6. This is a very confusing question!  How are you compiling your C programs?\n",
      "7. Why not using `isnan()` from math.h? Any specially reason?\n",
      "8. @Foon I just know that to compile in Linux I do gcc or g++ and in Solaris I do cc. Or am I wrong about it?\n",
      "9. do you want to send the 32bit number in binary form? or in ascii?\n",
      "10. Does your project involve some graphical user interface? What do you want to code?\n",
      "11. What have you tried? Where are you finding a problem?\n",
      "12. Usually compilers should generate a good code for such algorithms. Did you check what assembly a C compiler is generating?\n",
      "13. \"Cant see the error\" ? You mean your compiler crashes as badly on this code that you even can't tell us what he is complaining about?\n",
      "14. You want to compress strings from argv, really?  Or do you mean you want to treat argv's elements as names of files to compress, like gzip the program does?\n",
      "15. When I run the code I am able to select store and that validation is good, however when I enter in a purchase amount I get invalid message and am still able to enter in the negative values. Not sure if there is an issue with my while statement?\n",
      "16. @cHao Actually, i tried using select, but couldn't make it work. Can you give an example?\n",
      "17. Delimiters corresponding to what?  What are you trying to do?\n",
      "18. BTW you typo'd the declaration of `bytes_read`. And what on earth is \"incertitude\"?\n",
      "19. Too vague - explain what you expect the contents of the array to be afterwards - give a concrete example. Possibly also needs a homework tag ?\n",
      "20. This isn't the solution BUT,\n",
      "You can't assign values to a NULL pointer as you do in the start of tree_add IF the tree pointer is NULL, also you do not return any pointer from the function even though you specified that the tree_add function should return something?\n",
      "21. @omri yes you are right... I have applied the logic acc. to what I thought is right if somebody could tell me what's wrong I have done ?????\n",
      "22. Please specify the platform you are compiling on, and also specify the command line options to the compiler that you're using.  Is `-std=c99` one of the options, for example?\n",
      "23. What if I want to have another while loop within the main and split the record even further? I've noticed that then the first loop doesn't loop beyond just the first iteration, why?\n",
      "24. What platform? VisualC(++)/gcc/ANSI C?\n",
      "25. You could have forgotten an include that defined a type, forgotten a smicolon, lots  of things. Can you paste the code 10 lines before and after the location that the error indicates?\n",
      "26. The nth letter? Is this the Roman version of the Fibonacci sequence?\n",
      "27. I'm always amazed at how many questions are similar to this. Are people itching to write code like this?\n",
      "28. Maybe the \"junk\" servers a purpose to the application? What if you SETTEXT without the junk?\n",
      "29. Good question, worded poorly. Might want to try rephrasing it?\n",
      "30. no way! can you show us the entire loop?\n",

      "\n",
      "1. By literal value, do you mean the string? Or the ascii integer value?\n",
      "2. Generally, I'd anticipate a code bug. Can you paste in your FD_SET and your select calls please?\n",
      "3. Why is your code stored in a `.cpp` (C++) file, while the question is about C? So, what is it C++ or C?\n",
      "4. I added commentary. Does that explain what happens now?\n",
      "5. Explain what you mean by non-smaller? You mean bigger?\n",
      "6. Yes the second for loop has no braces as it contains a single statement within it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the time complexity of the above O(n^1.5) ?\n",
      "7. Actually it's probably a structure. I bet you declared `struct mystruct { int something; }` and then tried `struct mystruct myobj` followed by a `myobj->something` when you meant `myobj.something`, right?\n",
      "8. @g0d1anier: I'm just curious, is there a reason you want to use multithreading for this? It seems to me that your program will be completely I/O bound so you're adding a lot of complexity for little benefit?\n",
      "9. I haven't ever experience `GetClientRect` returning anything but the full client rectangle, no matter what overlaps it or if it is fully on-screen.  Are you sure?\n",
      "10. Are you trying to write a standalone program to invert matrices or write a `transpose` function as part of a bigger program?  If it's a standalone program, how is your program supposed to get its input and output?\n",
      "11. Are you saying this doesn't compile elsewhere? Ie this is xcode specific?\n",
      "12. Can someone include `getpid()` in the picture?\n",
      "`getpid()` in child returns 0?\n",
      "13. do you mean assembly code?  and you want a self modifying application?\n",
      "14. How do you compare strings? strcmp()?\n",
      "15. Is the asterisk really an asterisk in the source code? Or just a wildcard?\n",
      "16. \"remove all 0's and 1's\". So if your int is 2107900000 you want to get 279?\n",
      "17. Can you compile for 64 bits? If not, can you tell the compiler that your EXE supports up to 4GB?\n",
      "18. @Praetorian: You had me into tears. I agree to you but is that going to help me with my question?\n",
      "19. Wow! Trivial answer converted to comment! Is this new?\n",
      "20. I don't understand what's wrong with the standard C pre-processor. Can you clarify?\n",
      "21. yea, that code was crufty.. see the latest edit. it is still crashing when accessing the new array..perhaps the \\0 characters are getting lost in the shuffle?\n",
      "22. what type is curr_time2? What data type does get_time_in_seconds() return?\n",
      "23. why not `fprintf`? is this a homework?\n",
      "24. i can input number, number1. skips to letter2 why?\n",
      "25. You don't have any call to `fork()` in your sample program. Is this intentional?\n",
      "26. Pipes are IPC tools. Where's your other process?\n",
      "27. I think he is talking about the variable length arrays that were added to C in the C99 revision of the language. Is that correct aaa?\n",
      "28. how much have you studied yet? Do you want specific questions?\n",
      "29. two programs (processes) and two threads are completely different sets of beasts. which do you mean?\n",
      "30. Can we see the function that creates the output? And the output itself?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure the second argument (e.g. \"only\" or \"NA\") is in double quotes\n",
      "For each of these sentences, output whether the sentence contains a downtoner. Output True, if the sentence contains a downtoner, and false if it does not. If true, also output the modifier i the sentnece. Output your answer in the format of a json file, for example,\n",

      "Here are the sentences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When the breakpoint 'activates' is the `struct frame` in scope? Do you have more variables named `Frame`, possibly static to another translation unit or local to some function ... ?\n",
      "2. Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string-to-int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to \"re-convert\" the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?\n",
      "3. @Francesco: Why are you so against sharing the errors that you are seeing. Why don't you get that they are helpful?\n",
      "4. Let's talk about the error in a little bit more detail, Sergey. What is the output you get and what is the output you expect?\n",
      "5. Are you running in user mode or kernel mode?  Direct manipulation of the IDT is definitely not supported under Windows - what are you trying to do?\n",
      "6. I don't see any inherent problem with what you have done above, and it looks like no one else sees anything, either; can you post more code?   How certain are you that the setfault happens at that particular waitall?\n",
      "7. Why doesn't it compile?  What errors are you getting?\n",
      "8. Other than a missing declaration of 'ss', the code you've provided will get the address of a member of a structure. Can you provide more detail on what isn't working for you?\n",
      "9. Is this homework?  If so, could you please tag it as such?\n",
      "10. In addition to reformatting, can you try to provide some more info? Where are you stuck, what's going wrong?\n",
      "11. Seems like a roundabout way to get an address structure to me. Why not just pass \"2a00:1450:8006::68\" to `getaddrinfo`?\n",
      "12. @Thanatos: Interesting, however that statement implies that there are no multibyte string encodings that have embedded null bytes? Is that correct?\n",
      "13. Sorry, the question was not 'Is this correct, or what is correct?' it was 'Why does this work?'\n",
      "14. Which call to Print fails?  The first call?\n",
      "15. More likely than not it has to do with the way visual studio optimizes the loops. Can you post the generated assembly?\n",
      "16. Why would they be apart *without* optimization? I would imagine that the optimization is that space is allocated for both in advance?\n",
      "17. When you say \"`buf` is a string\", do you mean it's already a `char*`? And you're casting its address to type `const char*`?\n",
      "18. I'm still confused, unfortunately. Specifically, what could I do if I wanted to read the third line, for example?\n",
      "19. @aroth: Ouch. Don't you ever need to view side-by-side diffs?\n",
      "20. I see. Was it talking about that one specifically? :)\n",
      "21. By \"implementing square\", do you mean implementing a function such that `f(x) = x^2`, or `f(x) = x`? Also, what is the precise list of operators you are not allowed to use?\n",
      "22. Is there a particular reason you need it in binary format? Could you not use simple text output?\n",
      "23. If the struct is redefined, then everything that uses it's definition needs to be recompiled.  Is there a rebuild of all modues that know about the struct?\n",
      "24. The title says 8088 and the tags say 8086. Which one do you need?\n",
      "25. I've clarified the question, thanks ax. @runrunraygun: What is a community wiki?\n",
      "26. Paws__List is intended to be a _copy_ of List? not a reference or some sort of alias?\n",
      "27. What about a function like safe_free(void* ptr) { free(ptr); ptr = NULL; } or something like that?  Or what about some kind of struct wrapper and functions to manipulate it?\n",
      "28. The first (slightly stupid ;) ) question that comes to my mind is, do you really need to run as root? Or just need root access to some other stuff that you could sudo to, or use setuid rights to?\n",
      "29. I know little about compilers. Isn't cygwin just a compiler?\n",
      "30. Why? 99% of the time you can convert well written C code to C++ code by just changing the compiler setting. Why not start using C++ code?\n",

      "2. What exactly have you tested? You tested for the value you expect, I understand?\n",
      "3. Implicit `int`? Two returns in one method?\n",
      "4. It may be redundant in source, but is it redundant in binary? Is it a good practice to always check code like this because although all statements depend on the ones before them (in program flow), the program flow may change from any number of sources?\n",
      "5. What is `a`? Is there a value or just 0?\n",
      "6. do you include libfoo.h in libfoo.cpp? If you do an `nm` on the libfoo.a do you have the c++ name for the foobar() function?\n",
      "7. This looks right, and works for me. What do you see?\n",
      "8. Why not K&R? Was this just an excuse to bad-mouth some books you didn't like?\n",
      "9. What do you mean by 'access'?  Do you want to just read or also be able to write to the cell?\n",
      "10. It's a snippet, but mostly of where the action is. Suggestion to fix?\n",
      "11. Please clarify. You need to pass a data scructure from C to Lua?\n",
      "12. What is the problem here? Are you getting some unexpected results?\n",
      "13. it might depend on the actual definition of BYTE.\n",
      "Maybe `TRUE` and `FALSE` are already defined, so your `#ifdef`-ed code is actually never executed?\n",
      "14. sorry, wasn't really thinking about a definitive question. could we just say that my question is: is my interpretation valid or does it contain some problems?\n",
      "15. What do you mean by \"character\"? The drive letter?\n",
      "16. @Nobody: How much slower is that, these days? Do you have any data?\n",

      "29. How are you doing your shared memory? With shm_open and mmap?\n",

      "12. Nice problem, although proposing a solution is difficult because the criteria for a \"good\" solution can be defined in many different ways (and since a perfect solution might not exist, you need to define a measure of quality).

      "24. If you had such a list, what on earth would you do with it? The list of names in each category doesn't seem very interesting by itself; surely you don't want to actually process the content of all those grammars?\n",

      "1. Sorry, I thought you were looking for a connected subgraph, which will necessarily be a tree, appearing in a given set of trees. Could you clarify in what aspects  your problem differs from this description?\n",
      "2. Due to the different interpretations people have of \"independent\", can you please clarify your question. What do you mean by independent?\n",
      "3. Oh I see; I misread it, sorry.  So you want to know number the number of equivalence classes (via their language) of DFA of size n?\n",
      "4. I didn't catch the connection. Could you please explain further?\n",
      "5. @Prof. Kalai: Would you please point me to a good reference on Scarf's non empty core condition for the case of stable marriage?\n",

      "7. @Mark: Could you clarify something please?  You start by remarking that there is an undecidable problem P that is recognizable, and then observe that if HALT were decidable then we could construct a decider for P.  However, in the texts I have read, things are proved in the other order--the undecidability of HALT is used to demonstrate the existence of such problems P.  Can you show the existence of undecidable yet recognizable problems without using the undecidability of HALT?\n",
      "8. Really? Could you please tell us how to compute the maximum of $n$ $n$-bit numbers in AC$^0$?\n",
      "9. Good, I'm confused with the special terminology. Could you please simplify the terminology (or even better remove it)?\n",
      "10. Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I remember a nice theorem in one of Knuth's fascicles that said a boolean function is self-dual iff it can be expressed as the composition of majority functions. Has this observation been used in any algorithm for that problem?\n",
      "11. Please, add the first part to your post. You mean both players should have the same number of parts of the stick?\n",
      "12. Please don't downvote without stating your reason. Should this perhaps be turned into a wiki question?\n",
      "13. Despite the good answers, this is still a REALLY poor question a) because of the lack of information and confusing wording b) because - depending on what the question actually is - it's unlikely to be of use to anyone else. Can someone with edit permissions tidy it up ASAP, please?\n",
      "14. Please specify (1) what language you are using (eg PHP), (2) Any software you are using (eg Wordpress, Joomla, CodeIgniter and so on) and (3) what errors you are getting, if any. What do you mean by \"down\"?\n",
      "15. Your wording of the directory structure is a little confusing. Would you please update your question with a more specific directory structure and which HTTP error codes are returning for which files in that structure?\n",
      "16. Please provide more details: will you host more websites on a server? How are you uploading files?\n",
      "17. Hey, could you please tell me: if I decide to use Amazon CloudFront, what is the URL of my images going to be like? www.mydomain.com/image.gif or an Amazon CDN domain like www.ama-cdn.com/... (or whatever domains Amazon uses)?\n",
      "18. um... sorry... i mean... getting 100 results or 200 results from above search affects page rank or not? is 200 results better than 100 results in terms of SEO?\n",
      "19. Sorry, I'm not understanding what you mean. They don't have what data?\n",

      "22. sorry to extend the question, but how would i block the ip address? (using PHP?)\n",
      "23. @dan and sri, Sorry if this is too far from the original question, but is there a manner of linking (ie. the type of URL I use in my post) I can use to attempt to maintain the header (I'm *imagining* some `rel=` attribute to the effect of the capturing it), or does HTTPS always strip it out?\n",
      "24. Thank you. Could you please describe it more in detail or send some link dealing with logos in this software?\n",
      "25. ??? OMG! why? I thought every site must have one robots.txt. Can you please explain for me?\n",
      "26. I don't see what you mean with this question, nor can I imagine what kind of answer you search. Could you please elaborate more?\n",
      "27. Also (in addition to SV), can you please clarify why do you want to use beta-binomial analysis? The way I understand your question, you probably want to compare 1 .. 5 categories (right?)\n",

      "2. From what I can understand, it's not clear what is the response variable and the explanatory variable. Can you please clarify this?\n",
      "3. Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by the second sentence. Would you try and reword it?\n",

      "9. @mpiktas, sorry, could you clarify? A link to some kind of work illustrating what?\n",
      "10. Please provide the example of what you want to achieve. What exactly you do not get?\n",
      "11. can you really fix velocity and number of vehicles and vary the area? It does not look like it is possible to do controlled experiment in your case, can you please clarify?\n",
      "12. I have made some edits to your question. Please, could you check that I didn't alter its original meaning?\n",
      "13. @Tal Sorry, but it's not really clear to me what you actually mean by \"predict the lower and upper predictions of y\". Does it have something to do with prediction or tolerance bands?\n",
      "14. @bit-question, is this exact citation? Could you please give a reference?\n",
      "15. @Tim Why not posting this as an answer? Please?\n",
      "16. I'm sorry, but I can't understand what exactly you are looking for. What is your independent variable (the function), the dependent variables (the input values) and the parameters are?\n",
      "17. Does this answer your question? http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6181/can-the-multiple-linear-correlation-coefficient-be-negative  If not, then please provide more information: this is the \"SPSS output\" of what procedure?\n",
      "18. $N$ is not know? Could you please confirm?\n",
      "19. Thank you, that's exactly what I needed. I'm not completely sure of what you mean when you talk about the overdispersion (sorry, I'm not a statistician, maybe it's something very basic)... You say that the residual deviance should be equal to the residual degrees of freedom... how would I check that?\n",
      "20. @Tal Galili: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_means_never_having_to_say_you%27re_sorry. (My favorite is the line from *What's Up, Doc?*)\n",
      "21. Could you, please, point us to a correct calculation? ... in \"as if\" case?\n",
      "22. I'm sorry, what distinction are you making between the large sample formula and the small sample formula?  Are you calculating the variances using a population formula in large samples rather than using a sample estimate of the population variance?\n",
      "23. @kwak: I'm sorry to say I haven't a clue what this means. What do the symbols p, q, lambda, x, y, m and beta signify?\n",
      "24. @chi Sorry for the confusion, I meant a proportion for forest cover, and a binary indicator for presence or absence at each country. I think I get what you are saying here, would the assumption of not having an evolving generating model essentially be an assumption of 'stationarity'?\n",
      "25. I am sorry, I am just  a first year math student. Could you please provide/recommend a link/book/paper that describes how the relationship was derived?\n",
      "26. Sorry I'm still not clear, the movies are not just different between cinemas, the movies change too. If one cinema starts playing a new interesting movie while the others haven't, this one cinema may have bigger change in gaming sales, no?\n",

      "3. Could you please take a look at the pictures I added to my question? Am I on the right track?\n",
      "4. @cb Please note that some angles are not cyclic: the approach angle in the original question is a good example.  If you have a specific follow-up question, why not post it?\n",
      "5. Thanks both for your answers. Could you please direct me to a book/reference where I could find a proof of the fact that for large samples the paired t-test works?\n",
      "6. Could you please give me a reference, that 95% should lie between -1.96;1.96 . In other words, why should standardized residuals be $d_i\\sim N(0,1)$?\n",

      "15. Please describe the attacks you want to defend from. What are you seeing?\n",
      "16. Sorry to say, but I think this question may be too subject, too many parts for a simple answer or overly broad.  Something like codereview SO may be a better place..?\n",
      "17. Sorry @p_upadhyay, I reopened the question. Can you add the elaboration from your comments to the question?\n",
      "18. I'm sorry I'm not sure do I understand you. Are you looking for something like [OSSTMM](http://www.isecom.org/osstmm/) or the software which would support logistics / management side of the pentesting project?\n",
      "19. @Rakkhi - Thank you for acknowledging the question of SE OpenID usage on other sites.  Can you please also address the other point I've raised, of the specific case where SEI is both the OpenID provider *and* the provider of an online service with higher information sensitivity such as careers.SO?\n",
      "20. Sorry @atdre still somewhat confused. Using SSL would only help with applications that used SSL on the end, not with determining OS version or type or portscanning or anything like that, right?\n",

Sorry, reading a bit about alpha testing - it seems to come at the end of the pipeline, which introduces aliasing problems: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2011/05/06/antialiasing-alpha-cutouts.aspx.

      "3. Sorry, I'm a newbie in Physics world. But since you said that it's always with other stuff, can't we just weight the whole bundle of'em (quark with other stuff), then if we know the weight of other stuff, do simple math?\n",
      "4. Yes This is the correct answer. Can you please check if my proof below is correct?\n",
      "5. @space_cadet: Thanks for your answer.I have two question for you.Could please let me know how the conterfactual states are generated in the first place and what is the role of \\alpha s in getting rid of them?Because I've always just been taught that measurement gives each possible state with probability Tr(\\Pi_\\alpha \\rho) for different possible projections and we never talked about inconsistent states! And the second question is in a talk by Rob Spekkens (from PI) he said he believes an adequate set of postulates for quantum mechanics shouldn't have this inner-outer problem!What do you think?\n",
      "6. Sorry about not being clear, but I was talking about an idealised case where air resistance is negligible and the tires are perfectly rigid and there is no internal friction at play. So, then why is it 0?\n",
      "7. Please forgive me, I'm working on a 20-year-old High School math & physics education. So are two overdots the second derivative?\n",

      "9. Thanks again Robert! I will definitely work it out..But can you please explain about my confusion on whether it will provide normalizable or non normalizable mode (basically my first comment after your response) and in that case what will be the source that will couple to boundary operator?\n",

      "16. Either way, the whole point of the question was to see a concrete mathematical proof.  Instead of just saying it is so, can you please show how it is so, such that I can learn more?\n",
      "17. The Wikipedia page does not say anything about single electrons, and the original paper, \"[Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms](http://www.springerlink.com/content/q47427674u801u22/)\" seems to refer to silver atoms - not sure about this because the paper is in German and behind a paywall. Can you please clarify your answer?\n",

Dear @sb1, it's all great but could you please answer the main question - in non-engineering terms that often already suppose an answer without asking why - whether the energy just disappears in the form of electromagnetic waves and how much? How much do we have to try to \"catch it\" by surrounding the circuit?\n",
      "19. Sorry I should have asked it in more accurate words...yes I meant that it should be measured with respect to the aircraft's instantaneous position and not velocity... Would the cross-track wind measurement/direction change if it was measured with respect to the aircraft's 'airspeed' velocity than 'groundspeed' velocity? -- as the cross-track direction is effectively perpendicular to the instantanous velocity of the aircraft -- whether measured wrt to ground or air -- so its measurement/direction would not be infulenced by the aircraft's velocity... no?\n",
      "20. Sorry that does not answer my question. My question is, why do not people study electrons, say, artificially confined on a scale compared to the size of the nucleus ?\n",

Um...if two n-state DFAs are acyclic, then each merely accepts a finite set of words of length at most n, in which case their intersection is just the intersection of the two labelled transition graphs, which will have n states and can be computed in linear time and space.  Or am I missing something?\n",
      "8. Moritz - although the yes/no answer to this question is covered by Rice's Theorem, see my answer below for more interesting results.  Maybe, txwikinger, you should change the question to \"What is the complexity of the set {i : L(M_i) is in NP}?\"?\n",

      "6. Just a bit of feedback: assuming that this is the same question as your recent directed-acyclic-network before, it seems much clearer now. --- How's your linear algebra?\n",
      "7. You suggest that the process occurs with replacement.  Does this mean that you allow multidigraphs (with possibly multiple arcs from s to t)?\n",
      "8. @Lev: Your graph model can be seen as the sum of d independently chosen random graphs where each vertex chooses a next neighbour uniformly at random.  This would seem to make analysis easier?\n",
      "9. Great question.  Could you clarify what you mean by \"uniform\": do you want to bound the amount of preprocessing of the parameter?\n",
      "10. I am more than happy to be overruled (and can reopen the question), but this discussion should take place on meta, not in this comment feed. Why don't you initiate a discussion there ?\n",

      "12. $G'$ does not seem to add anything to your setup, as it is simply a forest of cliques.  You seem to be asking about the average connectivity of $G$, but what is the distribution of functions?\n",
      "13. @András: Sure, but that's not really related to the expansion properties. Let me rephrase: do we have examples of problems that are hard on $d$-regular graphs but easy on $d$-regular expander graphs?\n",
      "14. You can compute the convex hull in O(n log n) time. Do you mean if it's possible to do it in _less_ time than that?\n",

      "26. CodeIgnitor is a PHP framework - not a content management system. Are you thinking of ExpressionEngine (a CMS built atop CI)?\n",
      "27. Depends upon what you mean by 'point'.  Do you want to just redirect traffic from http://example.com/app to http://example.com:8080/app (and thus exposing port 8080 to external traffic) or do you want to hide the existance of Tomcat behind Apache, by running all requests through Apache to Tomcat, and returning all results back from Tomcat through Apache to the user?\n",

      "22. Just so I understand correctly the censoring issue: When you dilute a sample the concentration of a compound falls so low that the test instrument can fail to detect its presence. Is that an accurate re-phrasing of the censoring problem?\n",
      "23. You have already mentioned multiple imputation, the answer I'm thinking about. Why don't you use draws from truncated distributions?\n",
      "24. A simulation in R with varying n1, n2, s1, s2, and population difference would make a nice exercise. Anyone?\n",

      "29. At first blush this question seems purely mathematical: visualizing the function has nothing to do with the distribution of its arguments.  However, the reference to \"heteroskedasticity\" suggests you're really trying to visualize an object that is more explicitly represented as $f(x_1, ..., x_k) + \\epsilon$ or more generally as  $g(f(x_1, ..., x_k), \\epsilon)$ where $epsilon$ is a zero-mean random variable and $g(z,0) = z$ for all z.  Isn't this just a response-surface analysis?\n",
      "30. You could specify whether you need an introduction on applied statistics, or one on (theoretical) statistical inference.

      "14. It is not clear to me: are the independent (i.e. right hand side) variable continuous or discrete ?\n",
      "15. I think it would be excellent if you could give more detail (see suncoolsu's answer). Furthermore, with design, do you mean how to analyze the data?\n",

      "2. I would take a look at the question what-security-risks-does-ip-spoofing-bring . I feel these questions are very similar, if not duplicate?\n",
      "3. You mentioned OWASP, but not their [Web Application Firewall](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Firewall). Is there anything you'd like to do that isn't handled by the WAFs listed on that page?\n",
      "4. This depends almost entirely on what language, framework and application you're talking about.  What are you using?\n",
      "5. Are you also interested in common real-world uses of other Public/Private key protocols besides RSA (e.g. DSA etc?)\n",
      "6. I tried to capture the set of restrictions you wanted in the question.  Did I get it right?\n",
      "7. I'm not familiar with Australian laws, but I'd be surprised if there's anything there very different from similar laws elsewhere - answers would apply equally on other locales. Am I wrong about those laws?\n",
      "8. I suggest re-titling the question, as this has nothing to do with ebay.  Perhaps a title like \"How can I secure my PHP website?\".\n",
      "9. Btw, after answering I realized I wasn't clear about something - is this referring to Local Administrator, or e.g. Domain Admins?\n",
      "10. Thanks for editing this to provide a clearer statement of an interesting question, @Graham.  @Thunderror - does that capture what you were interested in?\n",
      "11. This seems hard and fragile.  Why not just directly address any CSRF vulnerabilities that your site has?\n",
      "12. No this is security. (what would server fault have to do with injection?)\n",
      "13. I'm going to say that this should probably be put on http://serverfault.com .  I believe you are wanting to set up Virtual Access Points?\n",
      "14. Newer SIM cards should have anti-tamper protection that makes it useless if you try to clone it. Have you already succeeded in cloning one?\n",
      "15. I'm not clear about this, if you're asking for a cryptographically secure random number generator - even with certain additional constraints - then that's easy, just tell us which platform/language you're on. If you're asking for something else - then it's not clear, and why would you ask on ITsec?\n",

      "17. @Rory ah, but you're still talking about general usage scenarios. What about the specific use case - connected to the Internet, but no outgoing connections except to Windows Update?\n",
      "18. @D.W. if thats the case, as I thought, it's not really a security question, is it?\n",
      "19. And NFS and DNS and other stuff too. Can you provide a breakdown by port?\n",

      "25. Btw, I realized that it is not clear from your question that you're asking about *your own* passwords, for other services, stored on your desktop (or laptop, or whatever) - as opposed to an application / service storing passwords for all registered users. Can you put that clarification in the question (assuming I understood correctly)?\n",
      "26. Perhaps I'm the only one seeing this, but it seems sort of vague-ish as to whether you're trying to address this from a client-side or server-side position.  I *think* you want it addressed in the website itself (server-side) - am I correct?\n",

      "1. I think there is probably a very useful question underneath this, but as it stands this is quite subjective; some individuals may worry more about one or the other (or both) but that might not be useful for you at the end of the day. Can you reword the question more towards specifics?\n",
      "2. Interesting topic. A missing part of the question, I think, is \"is homomorphic encryption considered *secure*, from a cryptanalysis PoV?\"\n",
      "3. To answer that we need to know what you want to do with it.  What are your goals?\n",
      "4. Seems very similar to http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/1634/which-instant-messaging-services-use-or-allow-secure-protocols-and-what-do-those - but there may be a slightly different goal here.  @LanceBaynes - Could you elaborate a bit, particularly in a way that distinguishes this question from the other?\n",
      "5. I'm following through here, with my comment on the original thread:  Vote to close as S&A.  On the other hand, perhaps (since this is particularly related to SE) we might carry this over to Meta?\n",
      "6. I like your hypothesis, however a more sinister option could be that they were attempting to use the tethering feature of their iPhone to take files off your network without them passing through your gateway. Although I think your hypothesis is more likely (do you work somewhere that people would go so such lengths to steal data?)\n",
      "7. Since you mentioned Evil Maid by Joanna, you already know the answer to your question. Am I missing something here?\n",
      "8. think this is too time localised to be on-topic. Any other thoughts?\n",
      "9. Very interesting question, I hope this eventually gets some answers! Are you talking only about *disclosure*, or economic factors in improving security in general?\n",
      "10. Not sure a honeypot that isn't in a production environment will teach you anything - you need attackers to connect to it in order to learn. Unless you are trying to do something different?\n",
      "11. Do you want the scans to be run continuously or on-demand. Also, do you want devs to be able to configure their own scans, or just trigger/request one?\n",
      "12. I don't know these tools, but re: *Ability to restrict password cracking* - I doubt that's what you mean - you really can't prevent someone from trying to crack a password hash, since it can be done on other machines.  Do you mean restricted access to the password hashes?\n",
      "13. There are not many ready-made exploits for max excel out there, at least not in non-commercial exploit packs. Which version of office do you have?\n",
      "14. I think one reason people think it's a lame question is that the OP didn't posit even one reason developing such a game would seem to be easy.    Kind of like asking \"Why is it so hard to fly like superman?\"\n",
      "15. @Cyclops: I think you can edit it to be community wiki and then downvotes won't have an effect. Perhaps a moderator can merge the answers of that question with this one?\n",
      "16. I'm not sure this is practical. So much game logic uses vector math, you'd have to either do everything in 3D before converting down to 2D or whatever for rendering, or you'd have to completely abstract away your vector library - which would surely be impractical?\n",
      "17. Well, if you have a O(V+E) algorithm, I'm really interested! \n",
      "Could you post it here?\n",
      "18. I've not used glut before, but it seems odd that a window would be receiving input messages if it *didn't* have focus.  Are you sure this is something you need to do manually?\n",
      "19. I think you *might* be slightly pushing the edge of gamedev, though I hope you find your answer. You may want to try the gaming stackexchange?\n",
      "20. Charles River Media was acquired by Cenage at some point.  I wonder if it ceased publication when that happened?\n",
      "21. 'Best' is rather subjective. Do you mean easiest to use, fastest, or most elegant?\n",
      "22. Title could be a bit better. Just to be clear are you asking \"What is the difference between C++ and Java on the Android Phone?\"\n",
      "23. An articulated body is not light on a physics engine as many shapes will be close to eachother and need to be tested for penetration (assuming they are jointed close together). What amount of shapes, what kind of shapes and what kind of contraints are involved?\n",
      "24. I can't tell if you're asking how a programmer can \"break in\" to the industry (convincing game companies they've got what it takes even if their experience is in financial software or something), or how a game programmer can get a non-game programming job (convincing other people that game programmers don't just play games all day but they actually have real programming skills).

      "26. You're asking about premade engines, but they're pretty specific things.  What kind of game are you thinking of building?\n",
      "27. As a sidenote, I wonder why they chose to call it \"Reach\"... I just got done playing some Halo: Reach so that came to mind immediately. But I suspect it's more because of the symbolism of \"reaching\" more devices?\n",
      "28. Sorrry,but i dont know where are these project properies. Could someone tell me?\n",
      "29. It's worth noting that in some companies, the line between \"design\" and \"marketing\" is imaginary. What becomes of your question when the person who does design is also involved in marketing?\n",

      "@Frédérick Imbeault Can you share a link to the article you read?\n",
      "2. I would also alter the title; currently it looks like an auto spambot. Maybe 'How to develop a concept and gain funding' might be good?\n",
      "3. Huh... I thought he was just overlooking the box, but you're right, @Tetrad, wiki is now mod-only. Seems strange, why wouldn't they allow users to apply it themselves?\n",
      "4. Hi Ivo. I think this is a good topic, but it's not clear what your code is doing - for example where does serverCurrentPosition, serverNextPosition, timeBetweenTicks come from?\n",
      "5. \"If you have played GTA 4, then you have probably been drunk at some stage.\" Because you must have been drunk to play a GTA game, eh? ;)\n",
      "6. Showing off code and showing off art or design are very different.  What specifically are you looking for examples of?\n",
      "7. Welcome, but you might want to rephrase your question - there is a rule of 'not asking how to make an entire game'. Maybe 'What resources exist for solitaire like games?'\n",
      "8. I don't think it should be tagged as a multiplayer game since that isn't given by the OP-it could be human vs AI. And by 'type dependency', are we talking the classic rock->scissors->paper->rock type thing?\n",
      "9. This seems rather subjective to me, as well as being possibly too wide-ranging. Wouldn't \"How to make a good game\", even for just 1 genre, seem to be a book-length topic?\n",
      "10. More like an API to be used by a mobile device. Does it matter what kind of client uses the API?\n",
      "11. Chances are, this doesn't exist. Also, language?\n",
      "12. I really doubt many people are going to **download** the code. Use code tags and place it in your question, or use codepad/pastebin on the forever-stay-up-there setting?\n",
      "13. I don't want to sound rude and don't mean any offence, but do you have any experience with coding normal physics (i.e. Rigid body physics)?\n",
      "14. That's odd, I have directX headers in my MinGW, and I don't remember adding them separately. Granted, my MinGW install is quite old, but when and why would they stop supplying those headers?\n",
      "15. No it doesn't really matter too much for your 50 odd sprites. But what's to lose?\n",
      "16. It looks like you get either wrong character widths or kerning values. Did you try disabling the kerning altogether to check if you get correct character widths this way?\n",
      "17. Gah. This keeps getting bumped by the bot. Can't we just close it?\n",
      "18. In this question's current state, I feel it would fall under 'how do I make game X'. And if you've made more complex games, couldn't you simply pick up an up-to-date API reference and write a framework? ;-)\n",
      "19. Let me rephrase your question. Whats the difference between fixed function rendering and Shaders?\n",
      "20. I don't think it needs the Homework tag, as even though this is homework, the question and answer would be the same regardless of the source. Do other people have to tag their questions in regards to their current occupation on the project?\n",
      "21. Joe is right. Maybe we could merge the two questions/answers?\n",
      "22. A good way to see if a question is off topic. If you remove \"Game Development\" from the question does it still seem like it would be on-topic?\n",
      "23. There have been several frustum/aabb culling code questions recently; would some expert make a definitive how (not why) guide that shows the steps e.g. how/  *when* to make the frustum, what transform to use on the things to test etc?\n",
      "24. Also, these kinds of questions are expressly frowned upon in the FAQ: \"your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”\".  Do you have a specific problem with specific requirements that you need a VM for?\n",
      "25. Might get better responses from Stack Overflow (http://www.stackoverflow.com/) - even though this applies to your games it's really programming. In the meantime... Can you not just put the DLLs in the same folder as your executable?\n",
      "26. You also don't define up in your view matrix (or any other matrix from what I can see). That could be a problem?\n",
      "27. This seems like a workable approach, but I don't see an actual question here. Are you asking how to make use of the result of your \"direction\" function to actually move an object?\n",
      "28. I've seen one on Nick.com ... I think. Or maybe Nick Arcade?\n",
      "29. I believe this artifact is called \"ghosting\" but I'm not experienced in iOS development so I don't think I could help you. Is there a difference in refresh rate on the iPad?\n",
      "30. No worries dude, we're all here to learn :) Yeah you'll most likely need to set your normals. Have you just tried darkening the colour from white to a grey and see if that shows it slightly better?\n",

      "7. almost a question for superuser. what \"kind\" of ubuntu are you running (or, to be more specifi, which desktop do you run?)\n",
      "8. I thought I read about that as a feature of MobileMe, but I just looked and cannot find it.  Have you signed up for a trial yet?\n",
      "9. putting the keyword (with special character) in quotes does not work. is there any other methods?\n",
      "10. This worked for me the other day.  Are you sure it happens for EVERY site you try to post a link to?\n",
      "11. There is no line that begins with \"X-From_:\" in the \"show original\" message. Any other suggestions?\n",
      "12. Besides this isn't asking for a web app solution, rather a server side solution.  Off Topic?\n",
      "13. Setting aside the circumventing of company policies, this is still a question about installing software on a server. Surely that's a ServerFault question?\n",
      "14. I have just tested this in a Google Presentation Document by copying the symbol in your question. It displays fine in design and when I click Start Presentation ?\n",
      "15. @GoodEnough It's not about other people reading your mail but about giving Google all your data. You now, *Do be evil* (or how was their slogan?).\n",
      "16. you cannot change an email address. Are you talking about the display name ?\n",
      "17. Asking for an iPhone app specifically is off-topic for here.  Try the Electronic Gadgets SE:  http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/614/electronic-gadgets maybe?\n",
      "18. 'Is it worth..' is very subjective. Can you rephrase your question in a more objective manner ?\n",
      "19. Could you provide more details , the summary of that question seems to be that special characters are ignored in google search which applies to this case. Is this the start of an expression ?\n",
      "20. I'm not sure I fully understand the problem. Are pick-an-email@domain addresses going to catchall@domain or does `pick-an-email` stand for one of the \"real\" addresses?\n",
      "21. Guess that makes this community wiki. Don't you think?\n",
      "22. I am having the same issue with Google Sync and an iPod Touch.  The issue of \"null\" where it should say \"ipod toch\"  Any suggestions on where to look?\n",
      "23. It's first choice in mine version. But what is this Custom there?\n",
      "24. You also seem to have 'Web' there twice. Which browser are you using, and do you have any greasemonkey scripts or plugins which may be breaking the links?\n",
      "25. Surely to embed HTML5 into another site that site has to be written in or support HTML5. Or am I missing something?\n",
      "26. Interesting concept. Have you tried just adding them to a list as you get follow notifications ?\n",
      "27. There may be a way to show a limited amount of content and then expand it or open in a box onclick using a custom script. How tied are you to the particular interface scetched in your image?\n",
      "28. interesting, i have used my google apps as the email to chat for some time and never had any problem connecting to other users.  Could you describe the issue you are seeing?\n",

      "7. Ok, I see my question is about a web service and thus a purist will flag to close it; however, I'm seeking an answer regardless.  Since superuser is for hardware and software related questions and not website software, err service, related questions; is there a stackexchange site for webservice related questions?\n",

      "10. I have the iPhone 4 but do not see API Keys at the bottom of the screen. Has this capability been removed ?\n",

      "12. can you clarify a bit. when you said 'I thought about adding some lists about science (500 users)...' are you talking about Following a list created by another Twitter user?\n",
      "13. I'm not sure what your problem is here. Is it that GMail let the e-mail into your inbox despite it being flagged as spam or from an address on your blacklist?\n",
      "14. As far as I am aware you should be able to do this.  Did you receive any error message?\n",

      "18. Since the _\\citation{}_ and _\\bibcite{}_ commands are in the .aux files, it should be quite easy to extract the relevant entries from a BibTeX database.  Has no-one written such a tool?\n",
      "19. I tend to prefer amsmath `\\begin{equation*}` over `\\[`, because it feels more semantic and makes the source more human-readable. But I really don't know, is there any difference between these two?\n",
      "20. Are you asking about preparing a presentation (e.g. using Beamer), or preparing a \"notesheet\" that is simply a guide for yourself as you're talking?\n",

Clearing caches will not really clear up space, it will just slow your page loading down until the cache is regenerated and fill up your memory again; and if there is not enough space to regenerate the cache, you will just experience the slow down.

What about this setting: Home > Menu > Setttings > Accounts & Sync \"Background Data\" and \"Auto Sync\" should be checked, then drilling down further, at the bottom of that settings screen click on the Google account that's associated with the calendar make sure \"Sync Calendar\" is synced.

      "12. I'm not sure I would say either of those phrases as it's unclear to me what they would mean, exactly.  Could you give a bit more context?\n",
      "13. This is still, even after the edit, unclear. Do you want to say that she is right and this was the best she could have said in this situation, or do you want to ask her whether she has nothing better to say, or do you want to add to the answer and propose the best follow up to her remark?\n",
      "14. \"I + have\" = proper agreement; \"she + is\" = agreement; \"she + would\" = agreement.  Am I missing something?\n",

      "21. Great question; too bad none of the answers have any clues to the origin though. There must be countless words which can approximate one second, so why the name of a southern US state?\n",

      "23. I'm not proficient in Japanese, so correct me if I'm saying something dumb, but last time I checked, か was a *final* interrogative particle, coming at the very end of a sentence and not changing the intonation of the rest of it, like, *at all*. As to your English examples, would you regard the rewordings \"Are you running into...\" and \"Is (it really (so that)) the fastest way...\" as sacrificing the content/format/impact?\n",

There are already plenty of reasonably commonplace words presented in answers, but (slipping into 'armchair philologist' mode) I can't help wondering if the process of 'word-sharing' between languages is skewed more towards *importing* rather than *exporting* in the case of Far Eastern languages.

      "3. \"I've simply been told before that itsa flow of electrons, but this seems to basic and does show that electricity is instant.\" Why would this mean that electricity is \"instantaneous\" ?\n",

      "8. Most of the books listed are more related to theoretical physics. I wonder if there is any \"bible\" for experimental physics?\n",

      "16. @David: okay, if you are taking your definition this strictly then the answer is much simpler: you cannot enforce the condition $\\dot{\\phi} = 0$. Why would you think you can do that in *these* coordinates in the first place?\n",

      "19. @Noldorin: this [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz) will disagree with you. Indeed when reading mathematical and physical literature (both books and papers) I encounter this word far more often than I would like :-) What's the proper English term, by the way?\n",

      "15. Extended Attributes will allow you to set some very liberal access permissions, and tell them to propagate inside the directory, and continue to do so on new creations, but for the life of me I can't find instructions. I can only do it on OSX Servers using the Server Admin Tools, which I assume is not a viable option here?\n",
      "16. You're not giving a whole lot of useful information. WHAT type of keyboard, i.e., brand, layout, and what language?\n",
      "17. Well, that didn't take long. The Mac App Store was released, what, less than two hours ago?\n",

      "19. @shodanex: The issue is likely to be specific to your particular hardware (or virtual machine), so you should describe it. Also, does the clock still drift if you turn “synchronize with internet” off?\n",
      "20. This question does not seem to make sense. You say both ends are routers, so assuming you set the routes correctly, and the routers are gateways, what is the question?\n",
      "21. I was thinking about this too - pbuilder is quite slow on my machine... unfortunately, I only have 2GB of RAM. Would that work for small projects?\n",

      "2. I think you have a point - but are these dishes popular with Indians because they are easily identified as vegetarian?\n",
      "3. Aha, thanks, that makes some sense although can't flexible gas pipes be used if that's a concern?\n",
      "4. Thanks for the tip. What is the best way to freeze it, though? I mean, aside from what I make with it when I finally decide to eat it, how do I best store it for another day?\n",
      "5. Just curious, how much did the leveling job cost?\n",
      "6. Is there a reason why all of you on here seem to be anti-car? I would find this amusing, but highly inappropriate behavior from our mayor in Seattle. Why is it something to laud here?\n",
      "7. Sorry to ask a stupid question, but... What exactly is this thing?\n",
      "8. how to use drush? or database?\n",
      "please help me more...?\n",

      "10. Out of curiosity what software have you used to draw your plan ?\n",
      "11. Sorry, I still don't get it? You want the nodes to be edited/deleted by the same role as node author?\n",

      "14. Is there anything else in specific you would like to know about the selecting coffee beans for roasting?\n",
      "15. I understand that *part* of the problem behind using cooking oil is that it goes bad and can smell faintly like, well, rotting food. Why does cooking oil do this and not chain lube?\n",
      "16. Thanks for the poking tip!  How long to cook?\n",
      "17. Are any of these answers useful enough for you to consider accepting one? If not, what else would you need in an answer?\n",
      "18. Thanks for your answer. Could you expand on what 2 hot wires are? Does that mean 2 live wires?\n",
      "19. Why is this closed? The asker is looking for organised week-long rides. He could expand his question a bit, give more details of the type of ride he is looking for, but otherwise, why?\n",
      "20. is there a particular book you would recommend to get started with molecular gastronomy?\n",
      "21. That's...pretty cool, actually. Would love to see this with a harder tire, though. Do you have manufacturer's ordering information?\n",
      "22. Sorry for my misspelling. Any recipes on using it?\n",
      "23. @Michael: What purpose does this serve besides being a list of milk? If it's just a list of milk, is that really useful?\n",
      "24. Could you recommend a good sump pump and battery powered backup sump pump?\n",
      "25. Have you done this before Nick? How is the cost compared to a grocery store?\n",

      "27. A very good explanation. Thanks. Which 'degrees' are those? Fahrenheit or Celcius?\n",
